# About
This is a proof of concenpt QR reading app using just plain old JavaScript and HTML. Uses [jsQR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsqr) to do the heavy lifting. 

# Running the app
 Everything needed to run the app is located in the /standalone folder and all the original code is inside kamera.js. Just open index.html in a compatible browser. *Some of the JavaScript APIs used are actually not very well supported at the time of writing this so only Chrome is guaranteed.*
